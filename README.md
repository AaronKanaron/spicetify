# Spicetify (not the other one)

This is a home project for learning Javascript and uses of an API (this case Spotify). 

This is far from perfect and would be 100% better if it were written in PHP or any other script with URL variables to handle the album and playlist sites. Saving the variable to local storage is pretty dumb but couldn't find another solution.

# Known problems:
- [ ] The Auth doesn't auto-refresh, need Client Secret and a log in (can't be bothered)
- [ ] User playlist is locked to Aaron Clauss
- [ ] Only the home button working, none of the others. (Still don't know what to do with them)
- [ ] Scrolling on the main page requires you to hold shift due to them being horizontal. Rotating the list (w. children) will cause large margins. Could be fixed with an absolute tag
